COMMENTS ON THE HATE SPEECH DATASET PREPROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION

1. Feature Distributions:
   
   - The histograms show how the values of hate_speech, offensive_language, and neither are spread across the dataset.
   - Observations:
     - The neither feature is heavily skewed towards higher values, suggesting many tweets fall into the neutral category.
     - hate_speech and offensive_language have more normal distributions but with peaks at zero, indicating most tweets have low or no hate speech or offensive language.

2. Box Plots (Grouped by Class):
   
   - The box plots show the spread of hate_speech, offensive_language, and neither values for each class.
   - Observations:
     - Hate Speech: Higher values of hate_speech correspond to tweets classified as hate speech.
     - Offensive Language: Higher values of offensive_language are linked to offensive tweets, but this connection is less obvious.
     - Neither: Higher values for neither appear in neutral tweets, as expected.

3. Pairwise Scatter Plots:
   
   - The scatter plots show relationships between the features, colored by the Class label.
   - Observations:
     - Thereâ€™s a clear separation between neutral tweets and hate speech/offensive tweets, especially when looking at the neither feature.

4. Correlation Matrix:
   
   - The correlation matrix gives a summary of how the features relate to each other.
   - Key Findings:
     - Hate Speech and Class: Strong positive link (0.695), meaning more hate speech leads to a higher chance of being classified as hate speech.
     - Offensive Language and Class: Moderate positive link (0.481), showing that more offensive language increases the likelihood of offensive classification.
     - Neither and Class: Strong negative link (-0.821), meaning neutral tweets are less likely to have hate speech or offensive language.

5. Heatmap of Correlation Matrix:
    
   - The heatmap visually reinforces the above findings, making it easier to spot strong positive or negative connections.
